Major Projects
Comprehensive Web Automation Script Execution Using Selenium and Flask
Technologies: Python, Flask, Selenium WebDriver, HTML, CSS
Page 2 of 2
I developed a robust web-based automation platform that integrates Selenium WebDriver for automating profile updates,
brand settings, system configurations and bank/invoice settings on the test-reidun.rebingtest.com website. The
project included dynamic form validation, password management, UI theme testing, and spell-checking for Norwegian
language inputs. Using Flask, I built an interface to execute Python scripts, log results, and capture output/errors in realtime.
The application enhances efficiency by automating login/logout processes, form handling, and validation tasks,
while providing error handling and detailed result reporting. Available in Github, Watch Demo Video
Reidun Documentation for Users
Technology: Mkdocs Documentation Tool
This documentation provides comprehensive user manuals for Reidun Website. It includes guides for using the login
page, navigating the dashboard, managing users, and adding new users. Each manual offers clear, step-by-step instructions
to help users efficiently operate and manage the system’s features. Live Demo
Transformer Model Optimization Bert
Technologies: Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Ktrain, Pandas
In this project, I harnessed the power of a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
model to enhance the performance of several natural language understanding tasks. BERT, being a state-of-the-art
transformer-based model, has proven to be highly effective in various NLP tasks, and our project aimed to fine-tune it for
specific datasets, such as SST-2, Amazon product reviews, and COLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability). Available in Github
